	while on your walks, make sure you behave yourself. Unless you see something that moves faster than you, ie. joggers, bikers , cars.  Then bark as LOUD as you can and pull.  Also, whenever you get the opportunity, run away.  Just keep running until you get tired, then go back.  This method almost always gets you a treat because your family will be jubilated with your return.  Suckers.

	another essential thing to enjoying your walks is finding a location that suits you.  I love any beach that I can get near, as well as a local dog park where my family allows me to run free without a leash!

	Hi, my name is Fang and I'm here today to instruct you regarding how to improve your life as a dog in innumerable aspects and educate you about how I achieve success on a daily basis.  

	First, I will attempt to ameliorate the greatest part of a dog's day: your walk.  By following these simple steps, you can improve your quality of life substantially.

	Also, you will learn how to exploit your family's weaknesses and extort anything you want out of them.

Biography:
	
	story about his life and all the homes he's been to.

	I was born on March 23, 2007 in Crystal Lake, Illinois.  My first home was in the suburbs of Illinois.  Back in the day, I was soft and uneducated, so I was incapable of achieving the greatest satisfactions in life.

Getting the most:
	
	his conniving tricks to fooling me and my parents into walking him more, longer, and in more enjoyable ways than most dogs get

	Don't poop until you start going back
	pretend you haven't been walked and get walked by every person
	be really loud and bark at every car or biker.... EVERY SINGLE ONW

manipulating:

	things he does not walking related to trick us into doing what he wants

		run off whenever you can to get treats and toys

		bang on the doors and gnaw your lesh when they walk by
